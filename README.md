## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I write stuff. Most of it are Bash and Python scripts, some of them get more involved. And here and there are Rust programs too. They are almost all exclusively command line driven tools. My (personal) interest are mostly Linux, Gaming, Steam, Emulation, RetroArch, but not limited to.

To make things even more complicated, visit my website where I list my favorite scripts and tools: https://thingsiplay.game.blog/my-projects/linux-command-line-tools/
